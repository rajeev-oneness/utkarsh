<p>Advanced Auditing and Professional Ethics for CA Final By Vinod Agarwal for November 2017 Exams.</p>

<p>This 19th&nbsp; edition has been thoroughly revised taking into account all the significant changes which have taken place in the sphere of recently notified Companies Act, 2013 and Engagement &amp; Quality Control Standards. It includes questions asked in the recent examinations conducted by ICAI and latest updates as per Revision Test Papers (RTF).</p>

<p>The greatest strength of this book is its conciseness and comprehensiveness. It covers each and every topic of the syllabus in a tabular and pointwise format. This book is only a humble effort to help the students to cope with the vast syllabus of Auditing. This book, though concise, yet is comprehensive and covers the entire syllabus.</p>
